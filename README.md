This program is a game similar to R-Type. It is coded with Arduboy in mind.

### Notes
This game has not been tested with the developer kit. A lot of memory is used,
but it should work just fine. If you have problems uploading the sketch,
press the left button and the up button while
switching the arduboy on.
This game is still in development and there are a lot of bugs and missing features
(see below). I am going to tackle the bugs first if feasible and then add features.

### Known bugs
* Explosions might occur when starting a new game
* Collisions are calculated very poorly

### Missing features
* Ships only have limited movements
* There are no levels or at least alternations of enemies. They just spawn randomly (but they do get stronger)
* There are no different backgrounds
* There is no sound (but there actually is no sound in space. I suppose it still counts as a missing feature)
